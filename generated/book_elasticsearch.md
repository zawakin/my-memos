# 1. Introduction to Elasticsearch
## 1-1. What is Elasticsearch?


## 1-1. What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed search engine built on top of Apache Lucene. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and provides near real-time search and analytics capabilities. It is used by businesses and organizations for a variety of purposes, including logging, e-commerce, and social media analytics.

With Elasticsearch, you can:

- Index and search structured and unstructured data in real-time
- Scale horizontally to handle large volumes of data
- Perform complex aggregations and analytics on data
- Secure data with user authentication and access control
- Integrate with a variety of programming languages and tools
- Monitor and troubleshoot performance issues

Elasticsearch uses a document-based data model, where each document is a JSON object containing one or more fields. Each field represents a different aspect of the document, such as the title or the body text of an article. Documents are stored in indexes, which are distributed across one or more nodes in a cluster.

Elasticsearch provides a RESTful API for interacting with the search engine, which allows you to perform indexing and querying operations using HTTP requests. Additionally, Elasticsearch provides a variety of client libraries for different programming languages, making it easy to integrate with your existing application stack.

## 1-3. Basic Concepts


# 1-3. Basic Concepts

Elasticsearch is a distributed, full-text search and analytics engine. It is built on top of the popular open source search engine, Apache Lucene. It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide near-real-time search results. 

## Document

The basic unit of data in Elasticsearch is a document. A document is a JSON object that contains key-value pairs of data. Each document in Elasticsearch must contain an "_id" field, which acts as a unique identifier. Documents are stored in indices.

## Index

An index is a collection of documents that have the same characteristics. Each index has a name and a set of configuration options that determine how the data is stored and processed. When data is indexed, it is stored in one or more shards.

## Shard

Shards are the building blocks of distributed search and indexing. Elasticsearch divides an index into multiple shards, each of which can be stored on a different node in a cluster. Shards enable Elasticsearch to distribute data and handle large amounts of data. 

## Node

A node is an instance of Elasticsearch running on a server. Each node in a cluster can store and index data, and each node can communicate with other nodes in the cluster. Nodes can be added or removed from a cluster without downtime.

## Cluster

A cluster is a group of one or more nodes that work together to store and index data. Clusters provide high availability and fault tolerance. Elasticsearch manages clusters automatically, and can rebalance data, add and remove nodes, and handle node failures.
# 2. Indexing Data
## 2-1. Creating an Index


# 2-1. Creating an Index
To start indexing data in Elasticsearch, you first need to create an index. An index in Elasticsearch is similar to a database in relational databases. It is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics or properties.

To create an index, you can use the PUT method in Elasticsearch's REST API with the name of the index you want to create. For example, to create an index named "myindex", you can send a PUT request to the following URL:

```
PUT /myindex
```

By default, Elasticsearch will create an index with one primary shard and no replicas. If you want to create an index with custom settings, you can include them in the request body. For example, to create an index with two primary shards and one replica, you can send a PUT request with the following request body:

```json
PUT /myindex
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 2,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
  }
}
```

You can also specify the mapping for the index in the request body. The mapping is a definition of the properties or fields of the documents in the index. For example, to create an index with a mapping that includes a "title" field of type "text" and a "price" field of type "double", you can send a PUT request with the following request body:

```json
PUT /myindex
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "price": {
        "type": "double"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once the index is created, you can start adding documents to it.
## 2-2. Adding and Updating Documents


# 2-2. Adding and Updating Documents

Once you have created an index, you can add or update documents to it. Elasticsearch uses a RESTful API to enable interaction with its documents. The common HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE are used to interact with the documents. 

To add a new document to an index, you simply send an HTTP POST request to the index endpoint, specifying the document data in the request body. For example, to add a new document to an index called "users", you would make a POST request to the following endpoint: `/users/_doc`.

```
POST /users/_doc
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

If the document already exists in the index, Elasticsearch will update it with the new data. To update a document, you would simply send an HTTP POST request to the same endpoint with updated data.

```
POST /users/_doc/1
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "age": 35,
  "email": "john.smith@example.com"
}
```

In this example, we are updating the document with ID `1` in the "users" index with new values for the `name`, `age`, and `email` fields.

Note that when you update a document, Elasticsearch will only update the fields that are included in the request body. If you leave out a field, that field will not be changed. If you want to delete a field from a document, you can simply set its value to `null` in the request body.

Updating documents is an important feature when dealing with dynamic data. Keep in mind that data should be structured in a way that it can be updated easily using Elasticsearch's API.
## 2-3. Deleting Documents


# 2-3. Deleting Documents

Deleting documents is a crucial operation that helps to clean up your index and remove unwanted data. You can delete a single document, a set of documents that match a query, or an entire index.

To delete a single document, you need to know its ID and index. You can use the `_id` parameter to specify the ID of the document you want to delete. For example, to delete a document with ID 1 from the index `my_index`, you can use the following request:

```
DELETE /my_index/_doc/1
```

If you want to delete all the documents in an index, you can use the `_delete_by_query` API. This API allows you to delete documents that match a specific query. For example, to delete all the documents that have a field `"status"` set to `"inactive"`, you can use the following request:

```
POST /my_index/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "status": "inactive"
    }
  }
}
```

This will delete all documents in the `my_index` index that match the query.

It's important to note that deleting documents in Elasticsearch is a relatively slow operation, especially if you are deleting a large number of documents. This is because Elasticsearch needs to update its inverted index and other internal data structures.

In general, you should avoid deleting documents if possible and try to keep them updated instead. However, if you do need to delete documents, it's important to do it in a way that minimizes the impact on your cluster's performance.
# 3. Querying Data
## 3-1. Search APIs


# 3-1. Search APIs
Elasticsearch provides several API endpoints for searching data within an index. The most commonly used are:

## The Search API
This API endpoint allows you to search for documents within an index using a query string. It supports filtering, sorting, and pagination.

## The Multi-Search API
This API endpoint allows you to execute multiple search requests within the same request. This is useful when you need to execute several queries at once.

## The Count API
This API endpoint allows you to count the number of documents that match a query string.

## The Validate API
This API endpoint allows you to validate a query string before executing the search.

## The Explain API
This API endpoint allows you to debug a search request by showing the scoring factors that contribute to the relevance score of each document.

When using these APIs, it is important to keep in mind the data structure and mapping of the index, as well as the relevance of the search results.
## 3-2. Filtering and Sorting Results


# 3-2. Filtering and Sorting Results

Filtering and sorting results is an essential aspect of any search application. Elasticsearch provides various mechanisms to filter its search results and sort them based on specific criteria.

### 1. Filtering Results

Filtering is the process of removing unwanted documents from the search results based on certain conditions. Elasticsearch provides two main mechanisms for filtering results:

#### Term Filter

The term filter returns the documents that match a specific term in a certain field. For example, to filter all the documents in the "books" index that have the word "Elasticsearch" in the "title" field, we can use the following query:

```json
{
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "filter": {
                "term": {
                    "title": "Elasticsearch"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Range Filter

The range filter returns the documents that have a field value within a specified range. For instance, to filter all the documents in the "books" index that were published between 2010 and 2020, we can use the following query:

```json
{
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "filter": {
                "range": {
                    "published_date": {
                        "gte": "2010-01-01",
                        "lte": "2020-12-31"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Sorting Results

Sorting is the process of sorting the search results based on specific criteria. Elasticsearch provides two main mechanisms for sorting results:

#### Field Sorting

The field sorting sorts the documents based on the values of a certain field. For example, to sort all the documents in the "books" index by the "title" field in ascending order, we can use the following query:

```json
{
    "query" : {
        "match_all" : {}
    },
    "sort": [
        { "title": "asc" }
    ]
}
```

#### Script Sorting

The script sorting sorts the documents based on the values returned by a custom script. For instance, to sort all the documents in the "books" index by the sum of the "price" and "discount" fields in descending order, we can use the following query:

```json
{
    "query" : {
        "match_all" : {}
    },
    "sort": {
        "_script": {
            "type": "number",
            "script": {
                "lang": "painless",
                "source": "doc['price'].value + doc['discount'].value"
            },
            "order": "desc"
        }
    }
}
```
## 3-3. Aggregations


# 3-3. Aggregations

Aggregations in Elasticsearch allow you to perform complex analytics on your data. They can be used to summarize, group and filter data based on certain criteria. Aggregations can be performed on a single field or multiple fields, and can be combined with other queries and filters.

To perform an aggregation, you first need to define what type of aggregation you want to perform. Elasticsearch provides several types of aggregations, including:

- Metrics aggregations: These are used to calculate statistical values like count, sum, max, min, and average.
- Bucket aggregations: These are used to group documents based on certain criteria, such as ranges or terms.
- Pipeline aggregations: These are used to perform calculations on the output of other aggregations.

Here's an example of a simple aggregation that calculates the average price of all products:

```
{
  "aggs": {
    "avg_price": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "price"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This aggregation calculates the average price of all documents in the index based on the "price" field. The result will be returned under the name "avg_price".

Here's an example of a bucket aggregation that groups products by category and calculates the average price for each category:

```
{
  "aggs": {
    "category": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "category"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "avg_price": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "price"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This aggregation groups all documents by the "category" field and calculates the average price for each category using the "avg" metric aggregation. The result will be returned as a list of buckets, one for each category, with each bucket containing the name of the category and the average price.

Aggregations in Elasticsearch are a powerful tool for data analysis and can be used for a wide range of applications, including reporting, business intelligence, and machine learning.
# 4. Mapping
## 4-1. Mapping Basics


# 4-1. Mapping Basics

Mapping in Elasticsearch is the process of defining how a document and its fields are indexed and stored. Mapping is essential for managing the searchability, relevance, and accuracy of your data.

At its core, a mapping consists of two things: fields and their data types. Every field in a document has a data type associated with it, such as text, keyword, date, or number. Elasticsearch uses this information to create an index that is optimized for fast search and retrieval.

When defining a mapping, there are several options you can specify for each field. For example, you can set the analyzer used for text fields, the format used for date fields, or the precision of numeric fields. Additionally, you can define the fields as indexed, meaning they can be searched, or stored, meaning they can be retrieved as part of a search result.

One important concept to understand is dynamic mapping, which is Elasticsearch's ability to automatically detect and map new fields as they are added to a document. This is useful when dealing with dynamic or unstructured data, but can also lead to mapping conflicts and unexpected behavior if not properly managed.

Overall, mapping forms the foundation of a successful Elasticsearch implementation, and understanding its basics is crucial for effective data management and retrieval.
## 4-2. Custom Mappings


# 4-2. Custom Mappings

In Elasticsearch, the mapping defines the fields and properties of a document that is stored in an index. Elasticsearch provides some basic data types for fields, such as text, keyword, date, integer, and float, but sometimes you need to customize the mapping to fit your specific use case.

Custom mapping can be used to define the type of data to be stored, the analyzer to be used for text fields, the format of date fields, and other settings. For example, if you have a property that should be interpreted as a date, you can specify the format of the date to ensure proper sorting when queried.

To create a custom mapping, you can define a mapping template in JSON format that specifies the properties and data types of fields. You can also create an index with a custom mapping using the PUT mapping API.

Here's an example of a custom mapping for a `product` index:

```json
PUT /product
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "standard"
      },
      "price": {
        "type": "float"
      },
      "created_at": {
        "type": "date",
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this mapping, the `name` property is defined as a text field with the `standard` analyzer. The `price` property is defined as a floating-point number. The `created_at` property is defined as a date field with a specific format.

Custom mapping is useful for defining the specific data types you need and optimizing your index for better search performance. However, it's important to note that changes to a mapping can only be made by reindexing the data or using the index aliases feature.
# 5. Scaling Elasticsearch
## 5-1. Sharding and Replication


# 5-1. Sharding and Replication

When dealing with large amounts of data, a single Elasticsearch node may not be sufficient to handle the load. This is where sharding and replication come in to play. 

## Sharding

Sharding involves breaking up a large dataset into smaller, more manageable chunks called shards. Each shard is essentially its own index with its own set of documents. By splitting up the data across multiple shards, Elasticsearch can distribute the search and indexing workload across multiple nodes, resulting in better performance and scalability.

Shards can be configured in a variety of ways, including fixed number of shards per index, automatic shard allocation based on node capacity, and manual shard allocation based on specific criteria.

## Replication

Replication involves creating copies of each shard, known as replicas. Replicas provide fault tolerance and resiliency by ensuring that there are multiple copies of each piece of data. If a node fails, the replicas can be promoted to primary shards to continue serving requests.

Replicas can also improve search performance by allowing search requests to be executed on multiple copies of the data, known as a "shard replica group".

Like sharding, replicas can be configured in a variety of ways, including the number of replicas per shard, automatic replica allocation based on node capacity, and manual replica allocation based on specific criteria.

Overall, sharding and replication are critical features for scaling Elasticsearch to handle large amounts of data and traffic. By properly configuring these features, you can ensure high performance and reliability for your Elasticsearch cluster.
## 5-2. Cluster Management


# 5-2. Cluster Management

In Elasticsearch, a cluster is a group of one or more nodes (servers) working together to provide search capabilities. Cluster management involves tasks such as creating, adding, removing or modifying nodes in the cluster.

## Adding Nodes to a Cluster
To add a node to an Elasticsearch cluster, simply install Elasticsearch and provide the same cluster name as the existing nodes. Elasticsearch nodes will automatically join the cluster upon starting up.

## Removing Nodes from a Cluster
To remove a node from a cluster, simply shut down the node and remove it from the list of nodes (if using a configuration file) or using an API call to remove the node. Elasticsearch will automatically redistribute data for the removed node to the remaining nodes in the cluster.

## Modifying Cluster Settings
Elasticsearch allows for a wide variety of cluster settings to be modified. Some of the settings include the number of shards and replicas, the allocation of shards to nodes, and various network communication settings.

## Cluster Health and Monitoring
Elasticsearch provides cluster health status to monitor the status of the cluster. The health status can be green, yellow, or red. A green status indicates that all primary and replica shards are active and available. A yellow status indicates that all primary shards are available but some replica shards are not available. A red status indicates that some or all primary shards are not available.

Additionally, Elasticsearch provides APIs and plugins for monitoring the cluster activity, performance, and resource usage. This information can be used to optimize the cluster performance and prevent potential issues.
# 6. Advanced Elasticsearch
## 6-1. Scripting and Plugins


# 6-1. Scripting and Plugins

Elasticsearch can be extended with custom scripting and plugins to enhance its functionality. 

## 6-1-1. Scripting 

Scripting in Elasticsearch allows users to write custom code to perform specific tasks during query and indexing operations. Elasticsearch provides a number of scripting languages such as Groovy, Painless, and Javascript. Scripting can be used for a variety of purposes such as dynamic sorting, filtering, and aggregations.

Elasticsearch also allows users to write custom scripts outside of Elasticsearch and use them through the Script File feature. This feature can be useful when users want to reuse or update their custom scripts more easily.

However, scripting comes with security risks, so it's important to review and restrict the usage of scripting in an Elasticsearch cluster.

## 6-1-2. Plugins

Plugins are software components that add specific functionality to Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch provides a number of built-in plugins such as the ICU Analysis Plugin for internationalization, or the Mapper Murmur3 Plugin for faster document routing.

Users can also create their own plugins to meet their specific needs. Using custom plugins allows users to extend Elasticsearch's functionality beyond what's available in the built-in plugins. The plugins can be developed both for the Elasticsearch server-side and for the clients.

Plugins are easy to install and configure, and can be automatically distributed to all nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster. It's important to note that each plugin has its own requirements and compatibility issues to consider before adding them to an Elasticsearch cluster.
## 6-2. Security


# 6-2. Security

When it comes to securing Elasticsearch, there are several options available, such as:

1. Transport Layer Security (TLS): It provides encryption between nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster, helping to secure communication.

2. Access Control: Elasticsearch provides various ways to control access to the cluster resources. One common way is to use built-in role-based access control, in which an administrator creates roles and assigns them permissions that restrict user access.

3. Auditing: It helps to track actions and changes made to the cluster. Elasticsearch offers audit logging for actions such as login attempts, document changes, and index deletions.

4. Encryption at Rest: It is the process of encrypting data when it's stored on disk. Elasticsearch supports various encryption-at-rest solutions, such as disk-level encryption, field-level encryption, and encryption with third-party plugin like Search Guard.

5. Multi-tenancy: Elasticsearch can be used to create separate domains on a single cluster, with unique security policies for each domain.

By employing these security features, Elasticsearch can provide protection to sensitive data and help organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.
## 6-3. Monitoring and Troubleshooting


# 6-3. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

Monitoring and troubleshooting Elasticsearch is critical to ensure that the system is performing optimally and that any issues are resolved in a timely manner. Here are some best practices for monitoring and troubleshooting Elasticsearch:

## Monitoring Elasticsearch
- Use the Elasticsearch monitoring API to gather system metrics, indexes status, and node status. This API provides real-time insights on the health of the Elasticsearch cluster.
- Use specialized monitoring tools, such as the Elasticsearch Monitoring Plugin, to track cluster performance over time. The monitoring plugin provides a better understanding of performance trends and helps identify and resolve issues before they turn into serious problems.
- Configure Elasticsearch to send logging data to a centralized logging system. This makes it easier to monitor and troubleshoot issues across multiple nodes and clusters.

## Troubleshooting Elasticsearch
- Use the Elasticsearch _cat API to diagnose issues with nodes, indexes, and shards. This API provides a human-readable output that can quickly reveal problems.
- Use the Elasticsearch _cluster API to diagnose issues with the Elasticsearch cluster. This API provides detailed information about cluster state, nodes, and shards.
- Use the Elasticsearch _recovery API to diagnose index recovery issues. In case of a node failure, Elasticsearch automatically recovers data from other nodes. The recovery API provides information on the status of this process.
- Use the Elasticsearch _snapshot API to create and restore snapshots of indices. This is useful for disaster recovery scenarios and as a backup solution. 

By following these best practices for monitoring and troubleshooting Elasticsearch, you can ensure that your system operates smoothly and meets your business needs.
