- The Force.com IDE, an Eclipse-based IDE that provides a full-featured development environment for building Salesforce applications using Apex and other languages.

## 3. Apex code structure
Apex code is organized into classes, which are similar to Java classes. Each class contains methods, which are similar to Java methods. Apex uses a syntax that is similar to Java, with some additional Salesforce-specific keywords and constructs.

Here is an example of an Apex class:

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void sayHello() {
        System.debug('Hello World!');
    }
}
```

In this example, the `public` keyword indicates that the class is accessible from other classes within the Salesforce organization. The `static` keyword indicates that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. The `System.debug()` statement outputs a debug message to the debug logs.

## 4. Apex triggers
Apex triggers are a special type of Apex code that runs when specific events occur within the Salesforce platform, such as when a record is created or updated. Triggers can be used to automate business processes, enforce business rules, and perform complex data transformations.

Here is an example of an Apex trigger:

```
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {
    for (Account a : Trigger.new) {
        // Perform some business logic
    }
}
```

In this example, the `AccountTrigger` trigger runs before new Account records are inserted. The `for` loop iterates over the new Account records, allowing the developer to perform logic on each record.

## 5. Conclusion
Apex is a powerful programming language that provides developers with a flexible framework for building custom business logic and automation within the Salesforce platform. With its strong type system, object-oriented features, and seamless integration with other parts of the Salesforce platform, Apex is an ideal language for building powerful and flexible applications.
